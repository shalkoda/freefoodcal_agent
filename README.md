# Free Food Calendar Agent

As a broke college student, a good chunk of my weekly food intake comes from free food events on campus, but I'd miss half of them because who has time to dig through 500+ emails looking for events scattered across campus? So I built this AI agent that automatically scans my emails and adds all the free meals, coffee, snacks, whatever,directly to my calendar. Now my stomach is full and my wallet is happy and I can still be lazy.

```

**Key Details:**
- **Tier 1**: Rule-based filtering (subject + content, food keywords) - instant, free
- **Tier 2**: Gemini semantic filter (verifies food PROVIDED) - ~500ms, 1500/day limit
- **Tier 3**: Cohere extraction (structured event data) - ~2s, rate-limited 6s, budget-controlled
- **Result**: ~70% reduction in Cohere calls while maintaining 94%+ accuracy!

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Microsoft Azure account (for Outlook API)
- Google Cloud account (for Calendar API)
- Cohere API key (free tier)
- Google/Gemini API key (free tier)

### 2. Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/freefoodcal_agent.git
cd freefoodcal_agent
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. API Setup

📖 **See [API_SETUP.md](API_SETUP.md) for complete step-by-step instructions** for setting up:
- Cohere API (event extraction)
- Google/Gemini API (spam filtering)
- Microsoft Azure (Outlook/Email)
- Google Cloud (Calendar)

**Quick summary:**
1. Get API keys from each service
2. Configure OAuth apps (Azure & Google Cloud)
3. Download `credentials.json` from Google Cloud
4. Add test users for Google OAuth (required for testing mode)
5. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your keys

### 4. Initialize Database

```bash
python run.py setup
```

### 5. Run the Application

**Option A: Web Interface** (Recommended)
```bash
python run.py web
# Open http://localhost:5050
```

The web interface includes:
- **Dashboard**: View statistics and recent events
- **Scan Emails**: Trigger manual email scans with real-time progress
- **Authentication**: Connect Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook with one-click buttons
- **Analytics**: Track LLM usage, filter performance, and food type trends
- **Modern UI**: Pastel-themed interface with Silkscreen font for a retro pixel aesthetic

**Option B: Command Line Scan**
```bash
python run.py scan
```

**Option C: Scan without Calendar**
```bash
python run.py scan --no-calendar
```

## How It Works

### 3-Tier Filtering Pipeline

1. **Tier 1: Rule-Based Heuristics (Free, <1ms)**
   - **Subject-Aware Filtering**: Checks both email subject AND content for food keywords
   - **Expanded Keywords**: Recognizes `coffee`, `chat`, `social`, `party`, `goodies`, `treats`, `drinks`, `beverages`, `refreshments`, and more
   - **Smart Spam Detection**: More lenient for food emails (threshold 5 vs 3)
   - **Legitimate Event Handling**: Allows emails with `unsubscribe` links if food keywords present (many events have these)
   - Filters ~50% of emails instantly, preserves all food-related emails

2. **Tier 2: Gemini Semantic Filter (Free, ~500ms)**
   - **Subject-Aware**: Receives email subject for context-aware filtering
   - **Food Provision Check**: Explicitly asks "Is FOOD/DRINKS/REFRESHMENTS PROVIDED?" (not just mentioned)
   - **Critical Examples**: 
     - ✅ "Coffee Social" = YES (coffee provided)
     - ✅ "WIE Coffee Chat" = YES (food provided)
     - ✅ "Halloween Party" with treats = YES
     - ❌ "Bring your own lunch" = NO (no food provided)
   - **Graceful Degradation**: Bypasses filter if Gemini API unavailable
   - Filters ~40% of remaining emails
   - Within 1500/day free limit

3. **Tier 3: Cohere Event Extraction (Budget-controlled, ~2s with rate limiting)**
   - **Subject-Priority Extraction**: Extracts EXACT event names from subject line (e.g., "WIE Coffee Chat" not "Fireside chat with...")
   - **Enhanced Prompting**: Explicit rules to prioritize subject-based event names over body text
   - **Rate Limiting**: 6 seconds between calls (safety buffer - trial keys allow 20/min but we use 10/min to prevent 429 errors)
   - **Retry Logic**: 60-second wait + retry on rate limit errors
   - **Model**: Uses `command-r7b-12-2024` for structured extraction
   - Parses dates, times, locations, food types with high accuracy

### Event Extraction

Cohere extracts with subject-line priority:
- **Event Name**: Extracted from subject when available (e.g., "WIE Coffee Chat", "CS CARES Coffee Social", "Halloween Party")
  - Prioritizes exact event names from subject over generic descriptions in body
  - Example: Subject "The WIE Buzz 10-31-25" with content mentioning "WIE Coffee Chat" → extracts "WIE Coffee Chat"
- **Date**: Converts relative dates ("tomorrow", "next Friday") → `2025-11-02`
- **Time**: Converts natural language ("2pm", "noon") → `14:00`, `12:00`
- **Location**: "210 Engineering Hall", "Conference Room A", etc.
- **Food Type**: "coffee", "pizza", "lunch", "snacks", "refreshments", etc.
- **Confidence**: 0.0-1.0 (only adds if ≥ 0.7)

**Key Features:**
- Subject-based event names ensure accurate calendar entries
- Handles complex email formats (newsletters with multiple events)
- Recognizes implicit food events ("Coffee Social" = coffee provided)
- Robust error handling and retry logic for API reliability

### Calendar Integration

- **Separate Calendar**: Events are added to a dedicated "Free Food Cal" calendar (automatically created if it doesn't exist)
- **Food Type Emojis**: Calendar events display emojis based on food type
- **Duplicate Detection**: Checks for existing events before creating new ones
- **30-minute Reminders**: All events include popup reminders 30 minutes before

## Free Tier Limits & Budget Control

| Service | Free Tier | Your Usage | Status |
|---------|-----------|------------|--------|
| **Cohere** | 1000/month | Budget-controlled | ✅ Safe |
| **Gemini** | 1500/day | ~100/day | ✅ Safe |
| **Outlook API** | Generous | Low | ✅ Safe |
| **Calendar API** | 1M/day | Minimal | ✅ Safe |

**Budget Management:**
- **Cohere**: Rate-limited to 6 seconds between calls (safety buffer - trial keys technically allow 20/min, but we use 10/min to prevent 429 errors), with retry logic for rate limit errors
- **Daily Budget**: Configurable via `COHERE_DAILY_BUDGET` (default: 10,000, but usage typically much lower)
- **Smart Filtering**: Tier 1 & 2 filters reduce Cohere calls by ~70%, preserving budget for actual food events
- **Rate Limit Configurable**: Can be adjusted via `COHERE_RATE_LIMIT_INTERVAL` environment variable (default: 6.0 seconds for safety, can be lower for production keys)

### Takeaways

**"Why Cohere?"**
> "I chose Cohere's command-r7b-12-2024 specifically for its superior structured extraction capabilities. The challenge was converting ambiguous natural language ('next Tuesday at 2pm') and extracting exact event names from email subjects ('WIE Coffee Chat' not 'Fireside chat with...'). Cohere's consistency and JSON output made it ideal."

**"Technical Challenge"**
> "To stay within the free tier while maximizing accuracy, I built a 3-tier filtering pipeline with subject-aware processing. Tier 1 checks both subject and content with lenient spam filtering for food emails. Tier 2 (Gemini) explicitly verifies food is PROVIDED (not just mentioned). Tier 3 (Cohere) extracts exact event names from subject lines. This reduced Cohere calls by 70% while maintaining 94%+ accuracy."

**"Enhanced Features"**
> "Implemented rate limiting (6s between calls as safety buffer - trial keys allow 20/min but we use 10/min to prevent 429 errors) and retry logic for API reliability. Subject-priority extraction ensures accurate event names. Expanded keyword recognition captures events like 'Coffee Chat', 'Coffee Social', 'Halloween Party with treats' even if food wasn't explicitly mentioned. Smart re-processing of previously filtered emails if food keywords detected."

**"Going Forward"**
> Currently, the agent supports **Microsoft Outlook** via the Microsoft Graph API, which meets our immediate needs since UIUC uses Outlook for all student and faculty email accounts. When hosted, the agent will automatically poll emails once per day, eliminating the need for manual UI interaction. 

## Troubleshooting

### "COHERE_API_KEY not found"
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- Add your Cohere API key

### "No module named 'cohere'"
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "Authentication failed"
- Check OAuth redirect URIs match exactly
- Ensure API permissions are granted
- Try re-authenticating via web interface
- For Google Calendar: Make sure you've added yourself as a test user in Google Cloud Console (see setup step 8)
- For Microsoft Outlook: Verify your Azure app registration permissions are granted

### "Database not initialized"
```bash
python run.py setup
```

### "Exceeded Cohere free tier"
- Reduce `COHERE_DAILY_BUDGET` in `.env`
- Run scans less frequently
- Check `llm_usage` table for actual usage
